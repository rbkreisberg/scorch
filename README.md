ScorcH
[![Build Status](http://nube.systemsbiology.net/github.com/rbkreisberg/scorch/status.svg?branch=master)](http://nube.systemsbiology.net/github.com/rbkreisberg/scorch)

Scorch is a heatmap for viewing and manipulating clustered data.

It builds on top of the jDataView and jBinary libraries as a means of compressing large datasets in flight.  The data is then rendered into
a canvas with a queueing system that does not interupt normal browser refreshs.
